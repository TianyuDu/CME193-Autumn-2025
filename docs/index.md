## Course Description
This one-unit workshop is aimed at students who already know how to program (CS106A or equivalent) and want to become fluent in the scientific Python stack. Each 50-minute meeting highlights real scientific-computing workflows with live coding in Google Colab. We will practice with NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and companion tools drawn from linear algebra, optimization, machine learning, and data science.

## Prerequisites
### Programming
There is no formal prerequisite check, but you should already be comfortable programming in at least one language (C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Matlab, R, Java, etc.). If Python is new to you, consider completing an online primer such as [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) or [Udacity CS101](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101).

### Scientific Computing
Expect to work with linear algebra, optimization, statistics, or similar scientific-computing topics. Prior exposure to simulation, machine learning, or data analysis projects will make the pace more comfortable.

## Format
CME193 meets for eight consecutive weeks each quarter. Sessions are hands-on and use shared Google Colab notebooks so you can experiment with the code as we go. In-lecture exercises at the end of each meeting reinforce the techniques introduced that day.

## Grading
The course is credit/no-credit and includes two graded homework assignments. To earn credit you must reach at least 70% of the total points (final cutoffs may shift slightly if assignments change). Each late day costs 10% of the full score, and assignments more than two days late will not be accepted.

### Late-Day Policy
- You start with **two** free late days that apply across all homework.
- Each late day grants a 24-hour extension; partial days are not allowed.
- Treat the free days as pre-approved extensions—use them before requesting additional accommodations.
- Beyond the two-day grace window, extensions are approved only for exceptional circumstances communicated to the instructor at least 24 hours before the deadline.

## Stanford Policies
### Honor Code
Collaboration is encouraged during lectures and on homework, but submit your own write-ups. If you collaborated closely, consulted online resources, or used generative AI tools, note those sources in your submission.

### Students with Documented Disabilities
Students needing accommodations should work with the Office of Accessible Education (563 Salvatierra Walk, 650-723-1066, [oae.stanford.edu](https://oae.stanford.edu/)). The OAE will evaluate documentation and issue accommodation letters. Reach out early so arrangements are in place before deadlines.
